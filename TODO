/*TODO
  -First and formost, we need to erase all the old files, i'll handle that for the most part. I.e. the raterooms and stuff
  -Remove Friends functionality
  -Make database for users
    -Possibly using Amazon Incognito
    -Info Needed:
      -Major (Selected from drop down)
      -Netid/Pass (Store it locally)
      -A username
      -A password
  -Change schedule to have the current class offerings list
    -Like default to the search page of the classes when we register. 
    -Maybe build our own mobile friendly version that in the backend interacts with the crappy Rweb one
  -Stabilze Ilearn page
  -Fix Rate my professor (It's broken)
  -Fix Library reservation form (It's broken? I think?)
  -Add advisor hours based on users selected major
    -We can do this by having if statments and presetting a page to crawl based on the users major. 
    -We crawl that page for the predefined text fields and return it.
  -Fix foodtrucks to open in the app
  -Add all the map functionality
